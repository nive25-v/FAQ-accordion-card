  * Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
  
My process

Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid

What I learned

I learned to tweak the checkbox input to hide and show elements

Continued development

I'm planning to create more complex flex and grid layouts. Things to learn from feedback:

  * add alt=" " for decorative images and not remove it from img elements. No h1-h6 inside a label tag.
  * learn abouth <detail> and <summary> tags. Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details
  * styling of detail tag: https://freefrontend.com/html-details-summary-css/
  
Useful resources

  * CSS Tricks - This helped me hack a checkbox to create a dropdown menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
